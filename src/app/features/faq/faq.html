            <p class="text-gray-300">
              After creating an account, search for the venue or add it if it's not listed. Rate based on payment reliability, 
              sound quality, staff treatment, load-in process, and overall experience. Your honest review helps other musicians 
              make informed decisions.

            <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-white mb-2">Can venues see who left specific reviews?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300">
              No. Reviews are anonymous to venues. Only other musicians can see your username, and only if you choose to 
              make your profile public. We protect musician anonymity to ensure honest feedback.

            <p class="text-gray-300">
              We investigate all disputes. If you have documentation (contracts, emails, photos), include them with your 
              review. We only remove reviews that violate our community guidelines or contain false information.

            <p class="text-gray-300">
              Focus on the fundamentals: pay musicians on time and as agreed, maintain quality sound equipment, 
              treat artists professionally, and communicate clearly about expectations. Good venues with consistent 
              practices naturally receive positive reviews.

            <p class="text-gray-300">
              Yes, venue owners can create accounts to respond to reviews professionally. We encourage constructive 
              dialogue, but responses that are hostile or threaten musicians will be removed.

              Document everything - contracts, emails, texts, photos. Report it in the app and consider reaching out 
              to local musician unions or legal aid. While we can't force payment, negative reviews warn other musicians 
              and create accountability.
