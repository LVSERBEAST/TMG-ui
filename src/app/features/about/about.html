        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">Born from Bad Gig Experiences</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          The Money Gigs was created by musicians who got tired of showing up to venues that didn't pay, 
          treated artists poorly, or had terrible sound systems. We've all been there - the club that 
          "forgot" to mention they don't have a sound engineer, or the bar owner who suddenly can't 
          find the money they promised.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          After one too many nightmare gigs, we decided to build something that would help musicians 
          avoid these situations and find the venues that actually treat artists with respect. 
          The Money Gigs is our solution - by musicians, for musicians.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          To empower gigging musicians with the information they need to make smart decisions about 
          where they play. No more gambling on unknown venues. No more getting burned by places 
          with bad reputations that other musicians could have warned you about.

          Our team knows the grind because we live it. We've played dive bars and concert halls, 
          dealt with shady promoters and amazing venue owners. We've had our gear stolen, our 
          pay withheld, and our load-in times changed at the last minute.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          But we've also experienced the magic of great venues - places where the staff treats you 
          like family, the sound engineer knows their stuff, and the pay comes exactly when promised. 
          Those venues deserve recognition, and musicians deserve to know where to find them.
